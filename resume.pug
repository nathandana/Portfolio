            p At Dealer.com I have grown to understand the ins and outs of working with large product and development teams, delivering conceptual work, while primarily focusing on fast-paced deliverables. I have honed my user research skills while working with analytics to drive AB testing and analysis to learn about our user base. Working with a product squad, I architected a large overhaul of the CMS tool that will define the future of how dealers interact with their web sites.

The page is the cornerstone of the user experience for thousands of car dealerships in North America. The SRP must support legacy aspects as well as set us up for years of future success. I have been primarily responsible for design of faceting, prototyping and research.
